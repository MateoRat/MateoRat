**Hey! I'm Mike. I'm an artist, writer, novice programmer, and the gay agenda.**

## WHAT TO EXPECT HERE/WHAT I'LL POST AND SHARE
- All the backend stuff for [Slashjay](https://mateorat.github.io/ "Slashjay's main website"), a post-Security Breach FNaF fan-comic
  - Yeah I know, I'm cringe.
  - The site is pretty immature in terms of my actual code, I'm self-taught for the most part aside from tutorials I search for and Reddit (bless) GitHub Pages ended up being the easiest hoster for me, so everyone gets to see my shitty little code if they truly feel like it.
  - I also ended up getting the site approved as an elective for school, so, sick.
  - I may share some of the assets from the site for folks to use if they feel like it... that'll probably appear as another project idk tell me if you'd like that.
- And... that's currently it. There may be more projects in the future. There are some ideas tho.
  - BlepBot, a Discord bot with no real purpose inspired by an image of Blue from Blue's Clues sticking her tongue out.
  - [okbutwhatisthis](https://www.youtube.com/@okbutwhatisthis/about) an ARG that I may or may not actually start working on. Chances are it'll be a mostly YouTube and Twitter thing but I might end up including more code and techy stuff. The current idea behind follows the main character (who I'll refer to as Protag 1) finding a strange VHS tape that's different every time it plays when going through some of his childhood CDs. 

## SOME THINGS ABOUT ME
wait you wanna read the wordy ass about me?<br/>
I'm interested in the internet, its history, and its culture, especially hacking and hacker culture, and piracy. I love pushing the boundaries of our tech and looking past the restrictions companies put on us. Some other spins (special interests) of mine are myseries (solves and unsolved) and rabbit holes, true crime, lost media (!!), urban exploration and abandoned structures (+ the history behind them), hacking and modding, piracy (it's culture and history... Nothing illegal going on here, mates), and some other stuffs!!

In terms of hobbies and some of my other stupid fandoms/spins and hyperfixations, I love drawing and writing, I'm currently working  my own personal story called Mythos/Shelter and, of course, slashjay, my goofy lil cringe FNaF comic! Once I get some more JavaScript and or Python experience under my belt, I wanna start work on a little Discord bot I call BlepBot. I'm currently hella hyperfixated on FNaF. I'm a stupid litte emo guy and love MCR. I'm also quite wordyâ€” has that become apparent yet?
