Hey! I'm Mike. I'm an artist, writer, a stupid beginner, and the gay agenda.

Currently I'm trying to learn the basics of programming. I'm interested in mainly JS and Python atm, I also know a bit of HTML and CSS for various projects I'm working on, though I'm defo still learning lol. I'm interested in creating a Discord bot some time in the future, I like some web development stuff, and I have way too many ideas and concepts that I think up.

I'm interested in the internet, its history, and its culture, especially hacking and hacker culture, and piracy. I love pushing the boundaries of our tech and looking past the restrictions companies put on us. Some other spins (special interests) of mine are myseries (solves and unsolved) and rabbit holes, true crime, lost media (!!), urban exploration and abandoned structures (+ the history behind them), hacking and modding, piracy (it's culture and history... Nothing illegal going on here, mates), and some other stuffs!!

In terms of hobbies and some of my other stupid fandoms/spins and hyperfixations, I love drawing and writing, I'm currently working on a fancomic for FNaF (cringe moment), my own personal story called Mythos/Shelter, and my unnamed lesbian detective story! Once I get some JavaScript and or Python experience, I wanna start work on a little Discord bot I call BlepBot. I'm currently hella hyperfixated on FNaF. I'm a stupid litte emo guy and love MCR.
